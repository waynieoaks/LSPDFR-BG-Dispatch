# BGDispatch for LSPDFR
BGDispatch provides similar functionality to some other great audio mods, such as "More Radio Chatter" or "X-Scanner". It has been written from the ground up to work alongside LSPDFR, GrammarPolice and Immersive Dispatch for a more joined up, emmersive audio experience...

## Dependencies:
Rage Plugin Hook 1.81+ (Required)
LSPDFR 0.4.8+ (Required)
GrammarPolice by opus49 (Reccomended)

## Installation:

## Current features: 
- None - I have not written it yet!

## Planned features: 
- Replace the police radio background chatter to make it seem more realistic
- Attempts to keep variety by not playing the same audio file if recently played
- Uses real audio files from real police channels carefully selected to be generic and remain lore freindly without revealing any personal data from real calls
- Ability to add personal audio files to the list
- Recognise when in a pursuit (LSPDFR) and hold background radio audio
- Recognise when talking to dispactch (GrammarPolice) and hold background radio audio
- Recognise when "Signal-100" initiated (Immersive Dispatch) and hold background radio audio
